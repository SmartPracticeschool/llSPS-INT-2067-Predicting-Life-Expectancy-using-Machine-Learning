Predicting Life Expectancy using Machine Learning

<p>A typical Regression Machine Learning project leverages historical data to predict insights into the future. This problem statement is aimed at predicting Life Expectancy rate of a country given various features.</p>

<p>Life expectancy is a statistical measure of the average time a human being is expected to live, Life expectancy depends on various factors: Regional variations, Economic Circumstances, Sex Differences, Mental Illnesses, Physical Illnesses, Education, Year of their birth and other demographic factors. This problem statement provides a way to predict the average life expectancy of people living in a country when various factors such as year, GDP, education, alcohol intake of people in the country, expenditure on the healthcare system and some specific disease-related deaths that happened in the country are given.</p>

<p>The purpose of this project is to develop machine learning regression model such that it helps in predicting the life expectancy of the people living in different parts of the world having different geographic, demographic, economic and social background.</p>
